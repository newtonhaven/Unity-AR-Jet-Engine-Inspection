Version: 1.5.0  
Platform: Android (APK)

## Overview
This is a Unity AR project using Google ARCore. The APK distributed in Releases lets you view and interact with 3D models (jet turbine, cockpits, etc.) in augmented reality on supported Android devices.

## Download
Download the latest APK from the project's Releases page (Assets → app-release.apk).

## Installation (Android)
1. On your device enable installation from unknown sources (Settings → Security → Install unknown apps).  
2. Transfer the APK to the device or download directly.  
3. Open the APK and follow prompts to install.  
4. If prompted, install/enable Google Play Services for AR (ARCore) from Google Play.

Minimum requirements: Android 8.0+ on an ARCore-supported device. For compatibility, check ARCore supported devices on Google’s documentation.

## Usage
- Launch the app and grant camera permissions.  
- Scan the environment and tap the screen to place models.  
- Use touch gestures to move, rotate, and scale objects.

## Features

- Multiple 3D models (turbine, cockpit, animated cat, etc.)

## Known issues
